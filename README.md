you'll get to see Javascript Integration with Docker

I have created a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) .This webApp not only runs docker command but also runs Linux Commands..

ðŸ“ŒThis app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:

âœ”date

âœ”cal

âœ”ls -l

âœ”fdisk -l

âœ”echo, cat, etc..



ðŸ“ŒThis app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:

âœ”docker images

âœ”docker ps

âœ”docker run

âœ”docker rm -f

âœ”docker exec
